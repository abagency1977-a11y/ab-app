  prompt: `You are an intelligent accounting assistant responsible for allocating a bulk payment from a customer to their selected outstanding invoices.

A customer has made a payment of {{{paymentAmount}}} via {{{paymentMethod}}} on {{{paymentDate}}}.

The user has explicitly chosen to apply this payment to the following invoices, which are listed in chronological order:
{{#each invoicesToPay}}
- Invoice ID: {{id}}, Current Balance Due: {{balanceDue}}
{{/each}}

Your task is to determine how to apply the payment amount to these selected invoices.

1.  Start with the first invoice in the list. Apply the payment to its balance.
2.  Do not apply more to an invoice than its current balance due.
3.  If the payment clears the first invoice and there's still money left, move to the next invoice in the list and apply the remaining amount.
4.  Continue this process until the payment is fully used or all selected invoices are paid.
5.  Keep track of how much of the payment is allocated to each invoice. The 'invoiceId' in your output must be the same as the 'id' from the input list (e.g., 'ORD-0036' becomes 'INV-0036').
6.  Any payment amount left over after all selected invoices are cleared is considered remaining credit.
7.  Provide a clear, human-readable summary of the allocations.

**Important:** Do NOT perform any balance recalculations yourself. Your only job is to decide how the lump sum of {{{paymentAmount}}} is split across the provided invoices based on their current balance due. The final balance updates will be handled by the system.

Return the result in the specified JSON format.
